                <p class="mx-2" style="text-align: left;">
                    <strong>Pablo Ruiz Picasso</strong>[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April
          1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist and
          theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of
          the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for
          co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
          sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety
          of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous
          works are
          <b><ins>the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907)</ins></b>
          and <b><ins>the anti-war painting Guernica (1937)</ins></b
          >, a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and
          Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.
          <br>          Beginning his formal training under his father aged seven, Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent from a young age,
           painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, 
           his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, 
           the Fauvist work of the older artist Henri Matisse motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, 
           beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of modern art.    
        Picasso's output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, 
        the most commonly accepted periods in his work are<b><ins> the Blue Period (1901–1904), the Rose Period (1904–1906), 
        the African-influenced Period (1907–1909), Analytic Cubism (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), </ins></b>
        also referred to as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a neoclassical style,
         and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.        Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, 
        Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.

                <p class="mx-2">            Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga,
                    Andalusia, in southern Spain. He was the first child of Don José
                    Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López. Picasso's
                    family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who
                    specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For
                    most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of
                    Crafts and a curator of a local museum.</p>

            <h2>Museu Picasso, Barcelona</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><strong> Museu Picasso in Barcelona</strong> is the most evident proof
                of the fondness and appreciation Picasso felt for the Catalan capital.
                The Museum would not have opened its doors on Carrer Montcada in 1963
                had it not been, on the one hand, for the will of the artist himself,
                and on the other, for the determination and commitment of several
                people: first of all, his personal secretary and great friend Jaume
                Sabartés, whose works by Picasso were the original core of the
                Museum’s collection; the artist’s wife, Jacqueline Picasso; members of
                Barcelona’s civil society who were both admirers and friends of
                Picasso, especially the Gaspar and Gili families, and finally, the
                Barcelona City Council. But the history of the Museum would not be the
                same without a key event that took place in 1970, when Picasso decided
                to donate to the city of Barcelona all the works that until then had
                been kept by his relatives in the family residence on Passeig de
                Gràcia.</p>
