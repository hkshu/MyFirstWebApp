    <p>
      Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish
      painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent
      most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of
      the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
      invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and
      for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among
      his most famous works are
      <b><ins>the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907)</ins></b> and
      <b><ins>the anti-war painting Guernica (1937)</ins></b
      >, a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian
      air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

    <h2>Early life</h2>
    <p>
      Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga,
      Andalusia, in southern Spain.[5] He was the first child of Don José Ruiz y
      Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.[14] Picasso's family was of
      middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in
      naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life,
      Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a curator of a
      local museum.[1]
