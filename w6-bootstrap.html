          <strong>Pablo Ruiz Picasso</strong>[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April
          1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and
          theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. One of
          the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for
          co-founding the Cubist movement, the invention of constructed
          sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and for the wide variety
          of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous
          works are
          <b><ins>the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907)</ins></b>
          and <b><ins>the anti-war painting Guernica (1937)</ins></b
          >, a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and
          Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

          <p class="mx-2">
            Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga,
            Andalusia, in southern Spain.[5] He was the first child of Don José
            Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.[14] Picasso's
            family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who
            specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For
            most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of
            Crafts and a curator of a local museum.[1]

        <p>
          <strong> Museu Picasso in Barcelona</strong> is the most evident proof
          of the fondness and appreciation Picasso felt for the Catalan capital.
          The Museum would not have opened its doors on Carrer Montcada in 1963
          had it not been, on the one hand, for the will of the artist himself,
          and on the other, for the determination and commitment of several
          people: first of all, his personal secretary and great friend Jaume
          Sabartés, whose works by Picasso were the original core of the
          Museum’s collection; the artist’s wife, Jacqueline Picasso; members of
          Barcelona’s civil society who were both admirers and friends of
          Picasso, especially the Gaspar and Gili families, and finally, the
          Barcelona City Council. But the history of the Museum would not be the
          same without a key event that took place in 1970, when Picasso decided
          to donate to the city of Barcelona all the works that until then had
          been kept by his relatives in the family residence on Passeig de
          Gràcia.
