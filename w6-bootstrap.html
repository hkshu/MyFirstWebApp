      Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish
      painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent
      most of his adult life in France. One of the most influential artists of
      the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
      invention of constructed sculpture,[8][9] the co-invention of collage, and
      for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among
      his most famous works are
      <b><ins>the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907)</ins></b> and
      <b><ins>the anti-war painting Guernica (1937)</ins></b
      >, a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian
      air forces during the Spanish Civil War.

        <p class="mx-2">
          Picasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of Málaga,
          Andalusia, in southern Spain.[5] He was the first child of Don José
          Ruiz y Blasco (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.[14] Picasso's
          family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who
          specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For
          most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts
          and a curator of a local museum.[1]

      <p>
        <strong> Museu Picasso in Barcelona</strong> is the most evident proof
        of the fondness and appreciation Picasso felt for the Catalan capital.
        The Museum would not have opened its doors on Carrer Montcada in 1963
        had it not been, on the one hand, for the will of the artist himself,
        and on the other, for the determination and commitment of several
        people: first of all, his personal secretary and great friend Jaume
        Sabartés, whose works by Picasso were the original core of the Museum’s
        collection; the artist’s wife, Jacqueline Picasso; members of
        Barcelona’s civil society who were both admirers and friends of Picasso,
        especially the Gaspar and Gili families, and finally, the Barcelona City
        Council. But the history of the Museum would not be the same without a
        key event that took place in 1970, when Picasso decided to donate to the
        city of Barcelona all the works that until then had been kept by his
        relatives in the family residence on Passeig de Gràcia.
